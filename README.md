# Sharing technology stuffs

The goal of this site is to keep references and notes on studies and best practices I have used to implement customer's solutions and to address some common problems I encountered while trying new technologies. 

All the content of this repository is visible as blog pages and website at [https://jbcodeforce.github.io](https://jbcodeforce.github.io). This web site is done using mkdocs so better to read it [in book format](https://jbcodeforce.github.io).
