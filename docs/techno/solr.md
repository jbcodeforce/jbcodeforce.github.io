# Apache Solr

[Solr](https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/) is a search server running in cluster and built on top of Apache Lucene.

It is used in document retrieval or analytical applications involving unstructured data, semi-structured data or a mix of unstructured and structured data.

Supports simplest keyword searching through to complex queries on multiple fields and faceted search results

It accesses to almost all of Luceneâ€™s text analysis features including tokenization, stemming, synonyms

## Getting started

See docker compose file in [solr]() to start one node and one zookeeper. The zookeeper is needed to let solr runs in cloud mode, which exposes the `api/solr` endpoints.

The typical steps are:

1. Create a collection
1. Define schema for the collection
1. Upload documents for indexing, and commit the changes
1. Start querying the collection

## Concepts

* The basic unit of information is a document, which is a set of data that describes something
* Documents are composed of fields, which hasa field type used to do better query.
* Schema stores the details about the fields and field types Solr is expected to understand. It can include normalization instruction.
* Faceting is the arrangement of search results into categories 

## Assessment

* What sorts of data do you need to index?
* What kind of query / search to perform?
* What are the criteria to assess search result quality?
