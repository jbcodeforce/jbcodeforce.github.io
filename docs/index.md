# Jerome's studies and notes

The goal of this site is to keep references and notes from my studies and may be define some best practices I have used to implement customer's solutions. It addresses some of the common problems I encountered while trying new technologies.

The left navigation is to go over the last technologies studied to address business application solution implementation based on event driven microservice, real time analytics leveraging artificial intelligence and hybrid cloud.

My interests are related to real time data processing, event driven microservice architecture, artificial intelligence like expert systems, machine learning, deep learning, but also IT architecture, like container, kubernetes, decision management, robotic and business process management.

All views expressed on this site are mine only, and do not represent the views of my current and past employers and customers.

## About me

As part of the IBM Garage solution engineering team, I am responsible to advocate reactive system implementation and design real time AI solution deployable on Cloud and OpenShift. My team builds delivery capabilities across IBM services and sales. 

My main roles are:

* Educate strategic customers on the value proposition of IBM Cloud, and participate in deep architectural discussions to ensure solutions are designed for successful deployment in the cloud
* Build deep relationships with senior technical individuals within customers to enable them to be cloud advocates
* Conduct one-to-few and one-to-many training sessions to transfer knowledge to customers considering or already using IBM Cloud
* Capture and share best-practice knowledge within the IBM Cloud Labs community
* Ensure success in building and migrating existing applications to the IBM Hybrid Cloud platform
* Author or contribute to customer-facing publications
* Act as a technical liaison between customers and product teams and help evolve the the different IBM products.

As a technical expert, I sell, create, and lead First of a Kind hybrid cloud artificial intelligence projects and resolves customers’ critical issues. I harvest architecture, best practices, and lessons learned from customer experiences through leading a team of solution engineers who are publishing reference architecture, template solutions, and patterns. I work directly with clients to lead them in adopting cloud private, hybrid integration, machine learning, and leveraging existing assets. Fervent agile practitioner, I’m hands on and love to discover new technology to solve complex problems.

For the last 10 years, I am presenter to every IBM conferences like Think, Interconnects, WebSphere conferences ...

I lead the following major open source contributions with all related sub-repositories (Current means still working on it on a daily basis):

* [Event Driven Architecture reference architecture](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-eda): Started Oct 2018 - Current
* [Event Driven Architecture reference implementation](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc): Started Oct 2018 - Current
* [Anomaly detection machine learning solution with real time analytics and event driven solution](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-reefer-ml) Started Dec 2019 - Current
* [Vaccine at scale solution](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/vaccine-solution-main)
* [Analytics Reference Architecture](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-analytics) reference implementation for building and running analytics application deployed on hybrid cloud environment with IBM Cloud private for Data. June 2019 - Current 
* [Hybrid Cloud Integration Reference Architecture](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-integration) describes an approach to connect components which are split across cloud and on-premises environments, or across public and private clouds -- even across different cloud providers.
* [Cognitive Reference Architecture solution implementation](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cognitive) build and run cloud based cognitive application using micro service architecture, Watson Cloud development APIs.
