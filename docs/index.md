# Introduction

This web site groups a set of studies, notes, technology summaries, references that I am using on my day to day work as IT architect and developer. This is a "pense bete". It can be considered as a set of blogs, but without the deep quality of a blog on Medium or Wordpress. Some of the links in the navigation bar goes to other sites, I developed over time to help customer, and more tailored to a specific subject like Event-driven architecture, AWS, messaging or AI.

If you want to leverage this content, better use the search or navigate into the top level menu.

Feel free to contact me if you want some help on one of those subjets. I may be able to help.

A bientot.
