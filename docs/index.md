## About me

I am currently IBM Distinguished Engineer, responsible to advocate Event driven solution and architecture with cloud native microservice and real time analytics or complex event processing. I do also play with AI to add intelligent to business applications and processes. I try to be as much hands-on as possible, to be able to provide good and tested recommendations to our customers. 

My main roles are:

* I help strategic customers to adopt hybrid cloud deployment, and specially event driven architecture to modernize their IT architecture so they can improve their business agility and scale their applications. The deployment of such approaches improve cost efficiency and increase the top line, as new opportunities are added easily. 
* The potential business impact is at the hundred of millions.
* I try to commit myself to be a trusted advisor, so I focus to continuously deeply learning new technology, programming habits, and agile practices. I try to code and play with new things on a daily basis. Days are long. The goal is to help customer to innovate and bring business values with new technologies. 
* My architecture skillset is around application modernization with event driven microservices, modern data pipeline, eventual data consistency and real time analytics.
* I lead incremental architecture workshops and prototype solution based on business requirements to proof the business value.
* I try to engage on long term, deep, business relationships with senior technical individuals within customers team and within my company. Problems are difficult, network of people who can help is important.
* I do a lot of mentoring too, so I like to capture and share best-practice, tribal knowledge, so team member can learn quickly to be more operational
* I author or contribute to customer-facing publications
* Act as a technical liaison between customers and product teams and help evolve the different company products.

As a technical expert, I sell, create, and lead First of a Kind hybrid cloud projects and resolves customersâ€™ critical issues. I harvest architecture, best practices, and lessons learned from customer experiences through leading a team of solution engineers who are publishing reference architecture, industry solution and reference implementation template solutions. 

### Major open source projects

I lead the following major open source contributions with all related sub-repositories (Current means still working on it on a daily basis):

* [Event Driven Architecture reference architecture](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-eda): Started Oct 2018 - Current
* [Event Driven Architecture reference implementation](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc): Started Oct 2018 - Current
* [Anomaly detection machine learning solution with real time analytics and event driven solution](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-reefer-ml) Started Dec 2019 - Current
* [Vaccine at scale solution](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/vaccine-solution-main)
* [Analytics Reference Architecture](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-analytics) reference implementation for building and running analytics application deployed on hybrid cloud environment with IBM Cloud private for Data. June 2019 - Current 
* [Hybrid Cloud Integration Reference Architecture](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-integration) describes an approach to connect components which are split across cloud and on-premises environments, or across public and private clouds -- even across different cloud providers.
* [Cognitive Reference Architecture solution implementation](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cognitive) build and run cloud based cognitive application using micro service architecture, Watson Cloud development APIs.

## This strange site

The goal of this site is to keep references and notes from my studies and may be define some best practices I have used to implement customer's solutions. It addresses some of the common problems I encountered while trying new technologies.

The left navigation is to go over the last technologies studied to address business application solution implementation based on event driven microservice, real time analytics leveraging artificial intelligence and hybrid cloud. This is always a work in progress, some subjects are at the beginning of the study, some are dropped as of now, but I could come later on it depending of customer's engagement.


All views expressed on this site are mine only, and do not represent the views of my current and past employers and customers.
