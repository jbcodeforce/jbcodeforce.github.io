## About me

I am currently a IBM Distinguished Engineer, responsible to evangelize event-driven, cloud-native solutions, real time analytics and complex event processing. I also help customers integrate AI to business applications and processes. I try to be as much hands-on as possible, to be able to provide good and tested recommendations to our customers.
