# Design Thinking

Design thinking is a methodology to standardize innovation process to develop creative solutions to business problems. This is a mindset and approach to problem-solving and innovation anchored around human-centered design: Who will be using this product? and How will this solution impact the user?

It uses design techniques, such as personas, empathy maps, as-is scenarios, design ideation, to-be scenarios, wireframe sketches, hypothesis-driven design, and minimum viable product (MVP) definition.

### Personas

Get to know the people that we intend to help with the future product. Collect information and answer a wide array of questions about them. 

* Who are they?
* What are their personal demographics?
* What are their normal tasks?
* What motivates them?
* What problems do they face?
* What frustrates them?
