# Freelance Consultant

Notes from Udemy course + articles.

## Introduction

As consultant, we find solution to problems and we are hired to solve them. As outside contractor, we are more objective than employees, not influenced by the same constraints than employees. We read between the lines, think out of the boxes, and find solutions.

Why becoming consultant: Jobs are not secured, more freedom, and there are taxation benefits (expenses). 

### Is there a Market? 

Yes people uses consultants. 40% of US workforce is tuning freelance in 2020. IT is always in high demand.


## How to do the job

* Understand the problem to solve
* **Where are we at the moment?**
* **Where do we want to reach? By when at what cost?**
* Once you have determined the desired outcome, deliver it, on time, on budget, on quality.

### Find your niche

* What are your talents? 
* Experience.
* What are the things people ask your help for?
* What falls within your **comfort zone**?
* What has worked and what has not worked.
* Be relevant and always up to date on the last news.

### Project management - Time

* Always defined a permissible variation of time. (around 10% and 15% )
* Use management PM tool, like [trello.com](https://www.trello.com), [Asana.com](https://www.asana.com)

### Project management - Cost

* Fee and costs are different. Fee how much you charge for the work, hours, week,... costs are for expenses, or hire more people to do certain job.
* Keep them clearly separate line items in contract. Set permissible variation in %.
* Cost can be hourly payment at the task
* But could be cost upfront from you and get paid later
* Make impact sheet: money customer spent with my service vs how much the customer will have paid for internal resources. This is a deliverable. 

### Project management - Quality

* Always keep the client in the know.
* This is what we agree with the client.
* Use sharing platforms such as Dropbox, Google Drive.
* Share prototype, always see intermediate steps.
* Get every step approved. 

## Tricks of the trade


### Dealing with the client

* Don't overkill (using academic words, buzz words...) or undercook (seat back lazily). Meet the client at the level they are at!. 
* Be sure to involve them in the problem solving exercise, do not let the client left out.
* Always do a client profiling: let them speak, do not be disruptive. Open up to ask them if they do not understand something you are saying.

### Contracts

* Always get a written contract. This is a performance based industry.
* At least deliver what you agreed and try to over deliver, as this is the best thing you can do to the client.
* Start from [Law depot](https://www.lawdepot.com/contracts/consulting-agreement) to get contract template.
* Fees are not define alone. Understand what the Market wants. 
* A rule of estimation: the annual salary in the company / annual working hours * 3.
* Charge by Hour, week, project based.

| Type | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Hours** | Better with uncertainty. Problem with dependencies. Spend more time that was planned due to client's circumstances | Link to time. Have a minimum amount per hours (15 mn?) |
| **Daily** | Same hours. Longer project. | What constitute a day. Define a minimum chunk of hours per day (4h) |
| **Fixed** | You know what needs to be done. Delivered, get paid. Good when reuse. Can be part of the reputation too. | Complicated. Fault management. Change management. |
