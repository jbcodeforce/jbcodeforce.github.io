# Skills

As a seasoned senior consultant, I have had the privilege of immersing myself in a wide range of technologies throughout my career. My insatiable passion for learning continually drives me to explore new concepts and expand my knowledge base. In this section, I would like to provide you with a high-level overview of the breadth and depth of my expertise in certain subjects.

My Git repositories showcase my commitment to delving deeper into specific solutions, as I consistently develop and refine assets that contribute to these areas.

* **3/2024 Skill Map**

The following figure illustrates the two main pillars for my knowledge base: software architecture and AI, with sub-pillars, I am continuously working on over time:

![](./diagrams/skill-map.drawio.png)

I will try to assess the skill level using the following definitions:

| Level | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **100	Foundational** |	I can present the feature overview, address value proposition, pro-cons, fit for purpose |
| **200	Intermediate** |	Being able to articulate best practices, demonstrate the product feature, code using the product |
| **300	Advanced**	| Bbe able to deep dive into a topic, a feature, an integration, and support deeper architecture discussions |
| **400	Expert** |  Product dev experience. Good knowledge on how a product works. Understand parameters. Code around the product deployment. Support long term consulting engagement. |
