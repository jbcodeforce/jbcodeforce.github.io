# Renaud Poupard "Inertia club" training

## Clinic

### 1. Learn the swing momemtum

* The body weight helps to create momemtum. The swing of the club. Set the image to push a child in a swing.
* In this club swing, the hands finish vertical and the club face is vertical.

* Clinic to work on momemtum: close to the green, do shipping, with just momemtum created by body rotation. No tension in arms, hands, feel the "balancier" and **inertia** after the ball stroke.
* With a pitch, work on the counterweight to the club with the body. A party of the body, the left, go to the target, while the club is on the back swing: the body acts as a counterweight. Loose backswing.

* Do not accept bad sensation.
* **Shallow swing** exercise: to build the snail image (head of the club designing a snail): short low backswing, being confortable, most important is to get the club inertia, extended arms, vertical club at 180 and finish on balance.
* Let the gravity play, on the descent the club fall with gravity, the right shoulder goes down with the club too.

* To get longer distance, we need to build a bigger circle: so go farther and lower on backswing, ease the arms, to get them extended at the impact, and be taller.

### Module 1

* "balancier": counterweight with the body at backswing and then on finish.
* finish in auto-pilot: in balance, club face vertical. shoulder face to target. 
* The swing is with the hips. The rotation of the hips, the shoulders drag the club. Exercise to ship by pulling the club and the ball.
* Look in front to the horizon, to set the body and squeleton in good position at address. Can even do dry swing while looking at the horizon.
* Also shipping by looking to the target is a good exercise for sensation and dosage

* Balance at the end of the swing, is very important (see the Relachement Rotation Rythm Equilibre principles from Leadbetter) and starts at the address.  
* Grip not in life line, be more in diagonal in the palm of the hand
* 

### Module 2

* Shallow practice for better ball contact
* Open club face, like in bunker, to have higher ball, but same swing and club face vertical when body is facing the target
* In case of socket, may be put the ball 2 cm farther. The club hits closer to the shaft. 
* Use counterweight and 7 second in the finish.

* Top came because of holding the club at impact, do dry swing to feel the inertia.
* The left arm is straight on back swing but not thighten, no tension, inertie brings the arm straight.  

### Module 3: Long iron and draw

### Module 4

Create space between club and body on back swing. 

**Topping** the ball is coming from a hand twist at impact or a small body movement upward. 
To avoid top or thin ball, use the under swing image, by dropping the club with gravity, keep the right shoulder low. Gather the ball.

### Module 5: Wood and driver

* Use shallow swing
* Keep club low when starting backswing
* Double finishes swing to feel the inertia of the club
* Start by doing short swing with driver, like it is an approach. 
* Speed comes from the swing arc
