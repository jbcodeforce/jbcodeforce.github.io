# Renaud Poupard training

### 1. Learn the swing momemtum

* The body weight helps to create momemtum. The swing of the club. Set the image to push a child in a swing.
* In this club swing, the hands finish vertical and the club face is vertical.

* Clinic to work on momemtum: close to the green, do shipping, with just momemtum created by body rotation. No tension in arms, hands, feel the "balancier" and **inertia** after the ball stroke.
* With a pitch, work on the counterweight to the club with the body. A party of the body, the left, go to the target, while the club is on the back swing: the body acts as a counterweight. Loose backswing.

* Do not accept bad sensation.
* **Shallow swing** exercise: to build the snail image (head of the club designing a snail): short low backswing, being confortable (this is something from the past), most import is to get the club inertia, extended arms, vertical club at 180 and finish on balance.
* Let the gravity play, on the descent the club fall with gravity, the right shoulder goes down with the club too.

* To get longer distance, we need to build a bigger circle: so go farther and lower on backswing, ease the arms, to get them extended at the impact, and be taller.
