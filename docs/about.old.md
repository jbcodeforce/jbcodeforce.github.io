## About me

I am currently a Principal Solution Architect at AWS focusing on helping customer to embark on the Cloud Journey.

I am an ex IBM Distinguished Engineer, focusing on event-driven, cloud-native solutions, real time analytics and complex event processing. 

My main roles are:

* Helping strategic customers to adopt the cloud and deploy their own software as a service.
deployment and specially event-driven architecture on Kubernetes to modernize their IT architecture so they can improve their business agility and scale their applications. The deployment of such approaches improve cost efficiency and increase the revenue as new business capabilities are easily added. The potential business impact is in the hundred million $.
* Leading incremental architecture workshops and prototyping solution based on business requirements to proof the business value in the form of minimum viable products.
* Supporting customers in long term, deep, technical relationships with senior technical architects.
* Mentoring developers, consultants and technical sellers.
* Capturing and sharing best-practices and tribal knowledge, so team members can learn quickly and be more productive.
* Authoring, presenting and contributing to customer-facing publications for conferences.
* Acting as a technical liaison between customers and product teams to help evolve the different company products.

As a technical expert, I sell, create, and lead First of a Kind hybrid cloud projects and resolve customersâ€™ critical issues. I harvest architecture, best practices, and lessons learned from customer's experiences through leading a team of solution engineers who are publishing reference architecture, industry solution and reference implementations.

I try to commit myself to be a trusted advisor, so I focus to continuously deeply learn new technology, programming habits, and agile practices. I try to code and play with new things on a daily basis. The goal is to help customers to innovate and bring business values with new technologies.
