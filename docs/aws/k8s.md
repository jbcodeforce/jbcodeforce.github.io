# Kubernetes AWS Service

## ECR - Elastic Container Registry

## ECS - Elastic Container Service

Amazon ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service, Amazon EKS is a fully managed Kubernetes service, 
both services support Fargate to provide serverless compute for containers. 
Fargate removes the need to provision and manage servers, lets us specify and pay for resources per application, 
and improves security through application isolation by design.

Apply docker compose to Amazon ECS and Fargate
