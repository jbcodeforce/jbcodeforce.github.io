## About me

I am currently a IBM Distinguished Engineer, responsible to evangelize event-driven, cloud-native solutions, real time analytics and complex event processing. I also help customers integrate AI to business applications and processes. I try to be as much hands-on as possible, to be able to provide good and tested recommendations to our customers.

My main roles are:

* Helping strategic customers to adopt hybrid cloud deployment and specially event-driven architecture on Kubernetes to modernize their IT architecture so they can improve their business agility and scale their applications. The deployment of such approaches improve cost efficiency and increase the revenue as new business capabilities are easily added. The potential business impact is in the hundred million $.
* Leading incremental architecture workshops and prototyping solution based on business requirements to proof the business value in the form of minimum viable products.
* Supporting customers in long term, deep, technical relationships with senior technical architects.
* Mentoring developers, consultants and technical sellers.
* Capturing and sharing best-practices and tribal knowledge, so team members can learn quickly and be more productive.
* Authoring, presenting and contributing to customer-facing publications for conferences.
* Acting as a technical liaison between customers and product teams to help evolve the different company products.

As a technical expert, I sell, create, and lead First of a Kind hybrid cloud projects and resolve customersâ€™ critical issues. I harvest architecture, best practices, and lessons learned from customer's experiences through leading a team of solution engineers who are publishing reference architecture, industry solution and reference implementations.

I try to commit myself to be a trusted advisor, so I focus to continuously deeply learn new technology, programming habits, and agile practices. I try to code and play with new things on a daily basis. The goal is to help customers to innovate and bring business values with new technologies.

### Some open source projects

I lead the following major open source contributions with all related sub-repositories (Current means still working on it on a daily basis):

* [Event Driven Architecture reference implementation](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc): Started Oct 2018 - Current
* [Anomaly detection machine learning solution with real time analytics and event driven solution](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-reefer-ml) Started Dec 2019 - Current
* [Vaccine at scale solution](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/vaccine-solution-main)
* [Analytics Reference Architecture](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-analytics) reference implementation for building and running analytics application deployed on hybrid cloud environment with IBM Cloud private for Data. June 2019 - Current 
* [Hybrid Cloud Integration Reference Architecture](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-integration) describes an approach to connect components which are split across cloud and on-premises environments, or across public and private clouds -- even across different cloud providers.
* [Cognitive Reference Architecture solution implementation](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cognitive) build and run cloud based cognitive application using micro service architecture, Watson Cloud development APIs.

## What is in this site

The goal of this site is to keep references and notes from my different studies and may be define some best practices I have used to implement customer's solutions. It addresses some of the common problems I encountered while trying new technologies.

All views expressed on this site are mine only, and do not represent the views of my current and past employers and customers.
