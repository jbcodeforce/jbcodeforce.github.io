## About me

As a current Principal Solution Architect at Amazon Web Services, I help customers adopt AWS cloud by designing complex solutions around data management for AI/ML constructs and application modernization using microservices, serverless and event-driven architecture.

I am an ex IBM Distinguished Engineer, focusing on event-driven, cloud-native solutions, real time analytics and complex event processing. 

My main roles are:

* Helping strategic customers to adopt the cloud and deploy their own software as a service.
* Leading incremental architecture workshops and prototyping solution based on business requirements to proof the business value in the form of minimum viable products.
* Supporting customers in long term, deep, technical relationships with senior technical architects.
* Mentoring developers, consultants and technical sellers.
* Capturing and sharing best-practices and tribal knowledge, so team members can learn quickly and be more productive.
* Authoring, presenting and contributing to customer-facing publications for conferences.
* Acting as a technical liaison between customers and services teams to help evolve the different company products.

As a [technical expert](./skill.md), I sell, create, and lead First of a Kind cloud projects and resolve customers’ critical issues. I harvest architecture, best practices, and lessons learned from customer's experiences.

I try to commit myself to be a trusted advisor, so I focus to continuously deeply learn new technology, programming habits, and agile practices. I try to code and play with new things on a daily basis. The goal is to help customers to innovate and bring business values with new technologies.

## What is in this site

The goal of this site is to keep references and notes from my different studies and may be define some best practices I have used to implement customer's solutions. It addresses some of the common problems I encountered while trying new technologies.

All views expressed on this site are mine only, and do not represent the views of my current and past employers and customers.
