## About me

I am an accomplished technology professional with a diverse background in event-driven architecture (EDA), hybrid cloud solutions (kubernetes and AWS services), business process and business rule implementation. With a strong track record as a former IBM Distinguished Engineer and my current role as a Principal Solution Architect at AWS, my expertise lies in guiding customers through their hybrid cloud journey, including messaging, data pipeline and AI model development and integration.

In my career, I have had the pleasure of assisting customers in a consultative manner, helping them adopt decision management, business process automation, data streaming, and complex event processing. I have a deep understanding of lean and agile methodologies, having authored books and blogs on agile business rule solution development, and being part of IBM Garage from the creation. Additionally, I have engaged with customers to facilitate the adoption of asynchronous and reactive systems based on IBM middleware, AWS serverless services, containers, and Kubernetes deployments. Furthermore, I have contributed to the definition of the next generation of several middleware products, showcasing my ability to drive innovation. I have led the development of IBM reference architectures for event-driven solution, Cognitive, and Data and AI. 

My main roles are:

* Helping strategic customers to adopt the cloud and deploy their own software as a service.
* Leading incremental architecture workshops and prototyping solution based on business requirements to proof the business value in the form of minimum viable products.
* Supporting customers in long term, deep, technical relationships with senior technical architects.
* Mentoring developers, consultants and technical sellers.
* Capturing and sharing best-practices and tribal knowledge, so team members can learn quickly and be more productive.
* Authoring, presenting and contributing to customer-facing publications for conferences.
* Acting as a technical liaison between customers and services teams to help evolve the different company products.

As a [technical expert](./skills.md), I sell, create, and lead First of a Kind cloud projects and resolve customers’ critical issues. I harvest architecture, best practices, and lessons learned from customer's experiences.

I try to commit myself to be a trusted advisor, so I focus to continuously deeply learn new technologies, programming habits, and agile practices. I try to code and play with new things on a daily basis. The goal is to help customers to innovate and bring business values with new technologies.

Outside of work, I am a devoted parent to three children, with my youngest daughter at WashU in St Louis studying environmental engineering, my sone currently pursuing a master in aerospace engineering at Cornell University, and my oldest daughter working as a software engineer in France. In my leisure time, I enjoy skiing, golfing, sailing, hiking, and engaging in family board games. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my bio. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute my skills and experience to new and exciting projects. 

## Publications

### Books

* Co Author: **Sustainable IT Architecture** Wisley
* Co Author: **[Agile Business Rule Development](http://www.springer.com/business+%26+management/business+information+systems/book/978-3-642-19040-7)** Springer.
* [Event-driven solutions virtual book](https://jbcodeforce.github.io/eda-studies/), I think a more flexible way to develop a book, and more agile to change content.
* [AWS Studies for Solution Architect Professional Certification](https://jbcodeforce.github.io/yarfba/)
* [Machine Learning studies](https://jbcodeforce.github.io/ML-studies/), same approach, it may become a book.

## What is in this site

The goal of this site is to keep references and notes from my different studies and may be define some best practices I have used to implement customer's solutions. It addresses some of the common problems I encountered while trying new technologies.

All views expressed on this site are mine only, and do not represent the views of my current and past employers and customers.
