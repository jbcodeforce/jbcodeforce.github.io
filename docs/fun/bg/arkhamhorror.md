# Arkham Horror LCG

## Rules we may forget

* After an attack monsters are exhausted.
* We can not discover more clues than were already available to be discovered from a location, regardless of the number of successes or card effects.
* All dooms in play are removed when agenda progresses, even the ones on player or enemy cards
* Prey only cares when an enemy needs a tiebreaker for who it moves to or engages to.  Apply when moving but also when ready.
* As long as an investigator isn't resolving a treachery with the "peril" keyword, each other investigator on the same location can commit one (only one per skill test) of their cards to that investigator's skill tests

## Strategies

* Apply the 2 point rules: to succeed a test in standard mode at least be sure to be two level higher than the test. +3 when bag becomes nasty.
* Use mulligan to get more useful cards like damage soak cards, character' specific card and card dealing with enemies as soon as possible
* Advance the act at the beginning of the turn or when having actions left, as enemy can spawn at the investigator's location
* Cards that help draw from encounter deck should be played at the beginning of the turn
* When taking a draw action, do it as first action, to deal with potential weakness or other bad things we could draw
* We do not have to pass every treachery. Better to keep good cards for next turns and loose health or horror at the beginning of the game.
* We do not have to kill all enemies. Evade no hunter enemy. Evade, investigate then move to other location is a good turn. Perfectly valid in solo play.
* Keep munition for 3 damage attack for big guy. Do not waste on 1 life enemies.
* We do not have to get every experience points of the scenario. Consider how many actions to go to the location and resolve the solution versus the scenario time line.

     * actions are our most important resources
     * take advantage of action economy: free move, picking clue without using action, free damage…
     * track our actions and the phase we are in.

* We should not rely on expected cards; use what you have at the time. We do not need to play all our assets.

* Do not think we need to be ready before moving in the scenario act.
* Assess if we need to go to a location or wait later when more ready.
* Card drawing and resource gathering actions should be less a priority when there is so much better things to do.
* Playing the campaign multiple times to adapt the deck with better cards and prepare the play. What enemy to fight...
* Assess before moving as a last action: may be better to stay with others; or better set in current location to fight an encounter.
* Know when to evade. Remember monster without hunter does not move. 
* Try to get a 2 damages at least per attack

### For solo play

* Avoid situational card, like [barricade](https://arkhamdb.com/card/01038), as the situation may never occur with a good timing
* Try to get more actions
* Avoid loosing test to do not loose action
* Remove card like deduction
* Evasion matters
* Characters good for solo: Roland Banks. 
* Cards that help us to get clues: Archaic Glyphs: Guiding Stones and both variants of Deduction

### Action Economy

When we can complete 2 or more tasks using 1 action or less actions than it would normally take.

Cards:
* emergency cache to get resources
* + 1 damage weapon
* deduction: 1 more clue in case of success
* short cut: move without action
* astral travel 

### Resource economy

 
### Deck building 

For standalone mode, we can build our deck with starting exp, which allows us to include pipped cards within the deckbuilding instructions. Add one weakness per 10 XP used. For campaign starts with 0 XP cards.

Always try to get answers to the followings:

* How do we plan to deal with 4 shroud locations and 4 combat enemies?
* What goes in the Hands/Ally/Arcane/Accessory slots?
* How will I pay for those expensives cards?
* What is my upgrade strategy?

Decide on our play style for that deck. If playing solo or with one other person, we'll probably want to build more conservatively, adding more cards to the deck that help to boost the lower skill scores. At 3 or 4 players boost on the character's strengths.

Some investigators have similar scores in fight and evade. Pick one as the primary. Focusing on both equally will lead to an unfocused deck and inconsistent games.

Try to get 12 to 17 assets per deck,  4 to 6 skill cards, specially while running a low resource investigator then remaining as events.  Consider tarot cards.

Pay attention to the costs of the cards we're adding to our deck. Add cards to generate resources. Common to add 2 emergency cash. Pay attention to the Skill bonus icons when choosing Asset and Event cards! These can be very useful when forming a "Plan B" for the deck.

Use neutral cards to boost some characteristics.

Any player cards that have an **encounter set logo** in the upper right should *never* be added to a player deck until we are specifically instructed to (most commonly this will be at the end of a scenario).

When playing 2 handed investigators: Combination: guardian - mystic  or guardian - survivor or seeker - rogue or seeker - survivor or mystic - rogue.

Deck building quick steps from (twisted tentacles)


Cards
- Aquinnah: level 1 is very expensive for survivors. So could be used by other classes with access to resources. While level 3 is only accessible to survivors, with a cost 4 and better skill: it avoids one physical damage per round, specially good on aoo.  It can damage aloof, and enemy engaged with another investigator. Try to combo with cards that make her ability trigger multiple times per round. It Should be useful to peter, william yorik to bring her back when her sanity reached 4. Use charisma and peter silvestre.  Inspiring presence helps to reuse her and remove horror from her. 



### Dunwich campaign 
    
* Necromencian book is used in miskatonic museum scenario even if available as base card in dunwich box
* Modify the content of the bag if the scenario tells us to do it.

### The circle undone campaign

Diane needs to get cancelled cards asap to increase her mental. Need spell attack, evade and investigate.


## INVESTIGATORs

### Diane Stanley - Pairing with Preston in Circle Undone

### Akashy Onyele

Deck [in arkhamdb level 0](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/752314) from [travis explanations](https://youtu.be/EDllmGqLTbE). Rite of seeking to help on clue. Upgrades: grotesque statue, arcane initiate, ward of protection 2, book of shadow, the lvl 4, arcane insight, suggestion, seal of the elder sign.

### Sefina Rousseau

- Her special ability can transform any event into a 5 instance card.
- Consider keeping events within the same goal: clue, combat, resources... And complement the others with assets. It improve consistency.
- Select agility or will power but not both. She is the only rogue with agility and will at 4. Very good for her.
- Protect her 5 lifes with dmg soak cards or healings.
- [video on her.](https://youtu.be/s1iwSS-kViA) 

### Harrigan

An [interesting deck.](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/2932/sophie-harrigan-s-guide-to-playing-the-soldier-1.0).


### [Ursula Downs](https://arkhamdb.com/card/04002)

Played her in FA. A [YouTube presentation.](https://youtu.be/__QgRbymv1k)

She is very single-minded stat set, GET ALL THE CLUES, EVADE ALL THE ENEMIES

- Focus on clues and move around. Use intellect to combat and evade most of the time.
- Add shrewd analysis to upgrade two copies of archaic glyth
- interesting relics: chthonian stone, tooth of eztli,  ornate bow, elder sign, key of ys, gold pocket watch. Now if playing with relic I need to have Eli Horowitz. 
- Boost her willpower for treasury : tooth of etzil, elder sign, logical reasoning
- Think to play the archaic glyth, so resolve it on first scenario of a campaign.
- 2 of each: unexpected courage, flashlight, emergency cash, trench coat
- Hyper awareness
- Add 2x doctor christopher, anatomical diagram, I have a plan, mind over matter to help on combat and evasion.
- Fieldwork is mostly mandatory to improve speed
- 2x shortcut, deduction, fieldworks, pathfinder,  no stone unturned.
- Muligan to get milan christopher out asap, and fieldwork
- Think to add charisma to have both christopher and jake out at the same time.
- Deduction can be upgraded
- +7 on investigation with fieldworks and Dt Christopher


### [LEO ANDERSON](https://arkhamdb.com/card/04001)

-  Leo is going to want a lot of allies, and Beat Cop and Venturer are standout level 0 ally cards for him
- Use Rogue cards to boost his resources gathering: Lone Wolf, Sleight of hand
- Not sure about leo de lucas… consider all allies in neutral, guardian and rogues
- charisma is mandatory to get more allies
- Mitch Brown helps to combo Beat Cop and Venturer. Venturer means .45 automatic to reload it
- Think about calling in favors
- interesting to consider: daring maneuver, decorated skull, eavesdrop, liquid courage, lone wolf [Solo], lucky dice [a must], narrow escape, quick thinking
- give more intellect power with treasure hunter, keen eye, and flash light. 


## Scenario commments

    - The midnight masks:  R2. 
    - Cultists we interrogated: ruth turner, peter warren
    - Cultists who got away: bill cooper, herman collins, victoria devereux, jeremiah pierce
    - It is past midnight
    - 5xp but skids has his hospital debts so only 3xps for him

???- "The Circle Undone"
    2023 with Nathaniel Cho and Preston Frairmont. Select the choice to be against the Twillight Circle. Not easy campaign. Evade can be a good strategy, at least for the Watcher.
