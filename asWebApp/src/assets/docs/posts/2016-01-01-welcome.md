Let restart blogging about new things I'm interested in. I will port my older posts that are still valid on agile business rule development but add new things around Cognitive, Watson, Machine learning, Decision management, complex event processing,...
So I will address best practices and comment on IBM Operational Decision Management, rule processing and complex event processing, Artificial Intelligence, Business Process Management, and cloud based development and deployment.
