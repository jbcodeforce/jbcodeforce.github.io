## Business rule and reference data

I have worked with a long time colleague and friend to present some patterns for integrating reference data management within a decision management product, like IBM ODM 8.0.1. See the article in developerworks [Strategies for managing reference data in a business rules application using IBM Operational Decision Manager](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/bpm/bpmjournal/1302_boyer/1302_boyer.html)

## Using IBM Operational Decision Manager DVS simulation features for risk scoring analysis use cases

A common issue related to rule-based risk scoring analysis is the ability to perform intensive simulation testing around specific scoring aggregation based on a huge data volume. This articles presents how to integrate datasource for ODM Decision Validation Service

### Stream Analytics

Streams can handle very high data throughput rates, millions of events or messages per second. A Streams application is a directed flow graph of operators.

Read this [quick start](https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/docs/streams-quick-start-guide/)

The service can be created in IBM Cloud: 

v 4.3 [Product documentation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSCRJU_4.3.0/com.ibm.streams.welcome.doc/doc/kc-homepage.html). 
The SPL Standard Toolkit provides basic data processing functions like filtering, aggregation, sorting, etc.
