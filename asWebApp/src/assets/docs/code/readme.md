### Hybrid Cloud Solution Implementation

* **[Hybrid cloud integration reference implementation](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-integration)** This is a huge piece of work to present hybrid integration, private and public cloud solution covering SOA, micro service, nodejs, angular 4, API Connect, Integration Bus, DB2 and java WS.
* **[Customer analysis with cognitive and analytics in hybrid cloud](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cognitive-analytics)** The goal of this implementation is to deliver a reference implementation for data management and service integration to consume structured and unstructured data to assess customer attrition.
* **[Dynamic Dialog with rule engine](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/context-driven-dialog)** This application demonstrates how to combine IBM Watsonâ„¢ Natural Language Classifier with a rule-based system (ODM Bluemix Business Rules Service) to offer a context driven conversation solution, full flexibility in terms of code change, empowering the business user to change the conversation flow and recommendations.
* **[Angular 5 web app integrating some TDD practices with Jasmine](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-caseportal-app)** and to deploy on IBM Cloud Private.
* **[Product recommendation in the context of user moving in different location](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cognitive-prod-recommendations)**
This project demonstrates how to leverage Watson Assistant to gather information about the customer intent, and propose the best product recommendations from his profile and the set of answers / facts gathered during the conversation.
* **[Customer Management Microservice](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-integration-services)** The goal of this project is to implement a set of RESTful services to manage customer, account, owned products and purchase order. The data persisted in DB2 include around 3500 fake customer records to serve as a training and test sets for churn risk scoring model.
* Business process management and **[Supplier On Boarding Business Process](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cognitive-supplier-process)** which illustrates how to integrate Watson Discovery inside of a human centric process, how to start a process from a chatbot, and how to call a chatbot in the context of a BPM coach / user interface.

### Cognitive, Analytics and Machine Learning

* **[The cognitive reference architecture supporting implementation for Watson Assistant or Discovery broker codes](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cognitive)** I present here two brokers to front end Watson Assistant and Watson Discovery as well as developing Watson Conversation tutorial and Watson Discovery tutorials
* **[Data analytics](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-analytics)** support the Data analytics reference architecture with solution covering machine learning, data governance and hybrid integration. This asset was presented at IBM Think conference 2018. The related assets are:
