# Apache Kafka

I am using [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/intro) in different projects as a messaging hub for its pub/sub model, persistence capability to support event-sourcing and to build real-time data pipelines and streaming apps. I described Kafka guidances in this [article](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-eda/blob/master/docs/kafka/readme.md) and include architecture considerations. 

I have detailed [producer best practices](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-eda/blob/master/docs/kafka/producers.md) and [producer code](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc-ms/tree/master/fleet-ms/src/main/java/ibm/labs/kc/app/kafka) and [consumer best practices](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-eda/blob/master/docs/kafka/consumers.md) and [consumer code](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc-ms/tree/master/fleet-ms/src/main/java/util) 

## Code examples

The [Container Shipment project](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc) uses Kafka for pub/sub model, microservice asynch communication, SQRS, event sourcing patterns and event analytics.


The [Manufacturing asset analytics project](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-asset-analytics) uses Kafka for pub/sub model and event analytics.

My own kafka studies and nodejs kafka samples in [github](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/nodejs-kafka)

In python kafka in my [github repo](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/python-code/tree/master/kafka) or as an [integration tests](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc/tree/master/itg-tests) for container shipment.
