My main roles are: Educate strategic customers on the value proposition of IBM Cloud, and participate in deep architectural discussions to ensure solutions are designed for successful deployment in the cloud Build deep relationships with senior technical individuals within customers to enable them to be cloud advocates Conduct one-to-few and one-to-many training sessions to transfer knowledge to customers considering or already using IBM Cloud Capture and share best-practice knowledge within the IBM Cloud Labs community Ensure success in building and migrating existing applications to the IBM Hybrid Cloud platform Author or contribute to customer-facing publications * Act as a technical liaison between customers and product teams and help evolve the the different IBM products. As a technical expert, I sell, create, and lead First of a Kind hybrid cloud artificial intelligence projects and resolves customers\u2019 critical issues. I harvest architecture, best practices, and lessons learned from customer experiences through leading a team of solution engineers who are publishing reference architecture, template solutions, and patterns. I work directly with clients to lead them in adopting cloud private, hybrid integration, machine learning, and leveraging existing assets. Recently I started to address how to enable Data Scientists to work more closely with IT architects to bridge the gap between the cloud private platform capabilities and machine learning tools and methodology used by the Data Scientists. Fervent agile practitioner, I\u2019m hands on and love to discover new technology to solve complex problems. For the last 10 years, I am presenter to every IBM conferences like Think, Interconnect,... I lead the following major open source contributions with all related sub-repositorties: Analytics Reference Architecture reference implementation for building and running analytics application deployed on hybrid cloud environment with IBM Cloud private for Data. Hybrid Cloud Integration Reference Architecture describes an approach to connect components which are split across cloud and on-premises environments, or across public and private clouds -- even across different cloud providers.
